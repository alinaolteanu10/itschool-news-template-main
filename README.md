This is my project created as part of an online Front-end Web Development course. 

The project includes four news categories, which were generated using The Guardian's APIs: Tech, Football, Business and Weather.
The first component of the website is the Home Page, which displays six news articles from each category (six cards). Each card contains the news title, description and image. The Home Page also includes links that lead to each category when clicked.
By accessing a news article, a new page opens, displaying specific details such as the publication date, content, description, and author. On this page, users can add the article to their favorites, triggering an alert that notifies them that the article has been successfully added.
This leads to the third page, which displays all the favorite articles. If the user wants to modify this page, they can delete an article. After refreshing the page, the data remains intact. Each page also includes a header and a footer, both styled with Bootstrap classes.

The project has been deployed here: https://final-project-news-it-school.netlify.app/
